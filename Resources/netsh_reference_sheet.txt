The syntax on this page is based on Windows 2008, for backwards compatibility with XP dns is an alias for dnsserver, ip is an alias for ipv4

Examples:

Install ipmontr.dll:
C:\> netsh advfirewall net add helper ipmontr.dll

Export the fiewall policy: 
C:\> netsh advfirewall export "c:\advfirewallpolicy.wfw"

Show TCP/IP settings
C:\> netsh interface ip show config

Set a static IP address (e.g. for a laptop)
C:\> netsh interface ip set address name="Local Area Connection" source=static addr=192.168.0.10 mask=255.255.255.0 gateway=192.168.0.1 gwmetric=1

Set a dynamic IP address with DHCP
C:\> netsh interface ip set address name="Local Area Connection" source=dhcp

Add multiple DNS servers:
C:\> netsh interface ipv4 add dns "Local Area Connection" 10.0.0.1
C:\> netsh interface ipv4 add dns "Local Area Connection" 10.0.0.3 index=2
index=2 adds the IP as a secondary dns server.

Set a static DNS server address:
C:\> netsh interface ip set dns name="Local Area Connection" source=static addr=192.168.0.2 register=none

Working with foreign locales: you cannot rely on the interface name being English e.g. in French the Local Area Network is called "Connexion au réseau local" (why yes that is unicode!) To display the different interfaces with their index numbers: 
C:\> netsh interface ip show interfaces
Knowing the index number (the main/active interface tends to be 13.) we can set a static address/gateway using the index number:
C:\> netsh interface ip set address 13 static 192.168.0.10 255.255.255.0 192.168.0.1 1

Set a dynamic DNS server address with DHCP:
C:\> netsh interface ip set dns name="Local Area Connection" source=dhcp

Set a static address for the WINS server:
C:\> netsh interface ip set wins name="Local Area Connection" source=static addr=192.168.100.3

To configure WINS from DHCP:
C:\> netsh interface ip set wins name="Local Area Connection" source=dhcp

List general configuration state including DirectAccess and DNSSEC.
C:\> netsh dns show state

Disable IPv6 privacy extensions:
C:\> netsh interface ipv6 set privacy state=disabled store=persistent (saved configuration)
C:\> netsh interface ipv6 set privacy state=disabled store=active (running configuration)

Backup the local DHCP server configuration to a file:
C:\> netsh dump dhcp > C:\backupDHCPconfig.dat
You can use this backup file to recreate the DHCP server with Netsh .

Work against a remote machine:
C:\> netsh set machine server64

Backup the current network interface configuration to a file:
C:\> netsh dump interface > c:\backupInterfaceConfig.dat

Restore network interface configuration from a file:
C:\> netsh exec c:\backupInterfaceConfig.dat

Run Netsh from PowerShell (returns a Text object you can manipulate) 
PS C:\> $myFWstate=netsh firewall show state
PS C:\> $myFWstate -match "disable"

Disable Network auto-tuning (certain routers and networking devices perform better with this off.) 
PS C:\> netsh interface tcp set global autotuning=disabled

Enable Network auto-tuning (certain routers and networking devices perform better with this on.) 
PS C:\> netsh interface tcp set global autotuning=normal
